# Academia del Amigo

**Academia del Amigo** is a free, web-based educational platform inspired by successful models such as Khan Academy and Udemy, but designed to be completely open, accessible, and aligned with the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education)**.  
Its mission is to provide inclusive, equitable, and high-quality learning opportunities for everyone, everywhere.

## Introduction

Education is one of the most powerful tools for human development and social progress. Yet, millions of people around the world lack access to quality education due to poverty, inequality, geography, or limited resources.  

This website aims to break these barriers by building a global, open-access educational platform where learners can explore knowledge, grow skills, and collaborate with others across borders.

This project represents a step toward ensuring that *no one is left behind* in the pursuit of knowledge.

## The Problem & Solution

- Over **244 million children and youth worldwide** remain out of school (UNESCO).  
- Adults face limited lifelong learning opportunities due to high costs or poor access to digital resources.  
- Quality remains inconsistent: many learners attend school without acquiring essential skills.


Key features:

- **Free Content**: courses in math, science, languages, and critical thinking.  
- **Adaptable Learning**: interactive lessons, from primary school to adult education.  
- **Community Collaboration**: forums, study groups, and mentorship across cultures.  
- **Open Contributions**: licensed teachers and subject experts can add and improve courses.

## AI Used in our Web

Throughout the development of the project prototype, we’ve accepted Copilot’s autocompletion suggestions, reviewed what it implemented, and decided whether to keep them in our code or discard them.

We accepted some proposals, among them the most important was the introduction and development of the contact section (name, email, and message fields), as a technical support feature for the page and an extra touch to make it more engaging. The structure and logic were made by the team consulting the presentations, online resources and AI suggestions and autocompleted; despite we have some AI content in our project code, we have taken the responsability by understanding the structure and logic of the AI generated code.

The prompts used for the team are like:
Chat, how can I add a tab in my HTML code so that a list is centered on the page without setting text-align: center?
What changes do I need to make so that the page can be viewed well on both large screens (computers) and small screens (cell phones and tablets)?
What is Bootstrap and how can I implement it on my code?

Also, there are several sections that AI facilitated us to autocomplete by pressing tab. We could have make it by our own but, having the rest of the code ready to complete by pressing a key, how to refuse it?

## Technology Used

- **HTML**
- **CSS**

  The future versions will expand those technologies and we may add a back-end solution and an improvement of the front-end.
